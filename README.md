## Subtheme Sentiment Analysis Task

### Overview

The task is to develop an approach that identifies subthemes and their respective sentiments from a given text sample. A subtheme sentiment is generally a sentiment towards an aspect or a problem within the review.

### Example

Consider the following review:

> “One tyre went missing, so there was a delay to get the two tyres fitted. The way garage dealt with it was fantastic.”

From this review, the subtheme sentiments can be identified as:

- Incorrect Tyres Sent: Negative
- Garage Service: Positive
- Wait Time: Negative

**Note:** Subthemes can either denote aspects of the service (which can be positive or negative) or problems (which are inherently negative).

### Task

Develop an approach that, given a sample review, will identify the subthemes along with their respective sentiments.
